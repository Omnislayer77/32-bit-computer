# 32-bit-computer
This is a simple 32-bit computer and successor to the R16 computer I made a while ago. It will be made mostly in C++ and with a python assembler. I plan to make this computer similar to the R16, but memory will be addressed by bytes and not words; it will have support for serial; it of course will be a 32-bit computer, have a 32-bit ALU, and have a 32-bit address bus, allowing it to address up to 4GB of information (although it probably wont, as I don't want the emulator to take up too much memory).
